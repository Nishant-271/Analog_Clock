
                           ANALOG WATCH PROCEDURE NOTES 


    Here , I will write the procedure which I will use in building the analog watch by using 
Html, css and javaScript .                      
 
 In a clock we can see there are three hands hour hand , minute hand ans second hand.

 So , we we want to ultimately display the time like 09:43:56  .So,i have to find the rotation 
 they cover during anticlockwise rotation .

###### CASE 1 : FOR HOUR HAND 

     12 hour cover krne ke liye hour hand rotate krega =360* 
     So , for 1 hour it will rotate = 30*     
     and for 3 hour it will rotate = 3*30 degree  

So , for general we can understand that for h hour it will rotate (30*h) degree

But we can see that hour hand me minute hand ki vjh se bhi kuch degree rotation aayega toh 
voh bhi ham dekhte hai :
      as we see earlier 1 hour rotate=30 degree rotation 
      so , we can write 60 min rotate = 30 degree rotatation 

Then, 1 min rotate = 1/2 degree rotation 
and 8 min rotate= 8*(1/2) degree rotatation

So , for general we can understand that for m minute it will rotate (m/2) degree roatation in
hour hand .

Toh minute hand ki trh seconds hand bhi hour hand me thoda bahut rotation krega but ham usse
calculate nhi krenge ku voh bahut jyada negligeble roatation perform krega.

So , for hour hand to know degree of rotation  for h hour and m minute be :

######            [ Formula = (30h + m/2) ]

###### CASE 2 : FOR MINUTE HAND 
       
      60 min cover krne ke liye minute hand rotate =360 degree

    So,to cover  1 min minute hand rotate = 6 degree roatation
    then for m minute ,minute hand rotate = (6*m) degree roatation 

    So, for minute hand to know degree of rotation for m minutes be , 

######            [Formula= (6*m) ] 

Toh again second hand ki vjh se minute hand me kuch rotation hoga, but voh rotation
itna jyada negligeble hoga toh hm usse ignore krenge .


###### CASE 3 : FOR SECOND HAND
      
    1 min cover krne ke liye second hand rotate =360 degree
   So , for 60 seconds , second hand rotate =360 degree
    So,to cover  1 sec ,second hand rotate = 6 degree roatation
    then for s second ,second hand rotate = (6*s) degree roatation 

    So, for second hand to know degree of rotation for s second be, 

######            [Formula= (6*s) ] 


######        BASIC  APPROCHES

Our basic approch is that ::

1. we will take simple clock.png image from google which don't have any hand in it .
2. then we will create three hands one for hour , one for minute 
and one for second then we will firstly assign all these three hands to point 12 in a image.
3. By using javascript , i will know what was the current time going on ,
4. and according to that time change my hands correspondingly .
5. By using javascript i will make those hour,mind and second hand to work responsively .
6. BY using above derive formulas , we can continuously rotate 
our hour hand,second hand and minute hand.
